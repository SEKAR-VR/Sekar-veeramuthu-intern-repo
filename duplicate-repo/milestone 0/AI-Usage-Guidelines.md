## When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?  
AI should be used for tasks that require speed, efficiency, and automation, such as generating code snippets, debugging, summarizing information, and brainstorming ideas. It is useful for repetitive tasks and quick problem-solving.  

However, you should rely on your own skills when making critical decisions, verifying information, or handling complex problem-solving that requires human judgment, creativity, or ethical considerations. AI should support decision-making but not replace expertise.  

## How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?  
- Use AI as a tool to **enhance** productivity, not as a **substitute** for thinking and learning.  
- Always **review and validate** AI-generated content before using it.  
- Continue **developing skills independently** through learning and hands-on experience.  
- Set **clear boundaries** on when to use AI (e.g., assistance in research but not final decision-making).  

## What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?  
- **Never enter sensitive or confidential information** (e.g., company data, passwords, personal details) into AI tools.  
- **Use organization-approved AI tools** that comply with data security policies.  
- **Regularly review and follow company guidelines** on AI usage and data protection.  
- **Be cautious about AI-generated outputs** before sharing them in a professional setting.
