# Learning Goals – Focus Bear Internship

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?

I hope to gain practical experience in automated quality assurance workflows within a real-world product development environment. I want to deepen my understanding of CI/CD pipelines, automated testing frameworks, and QA best practices, while also improving my ability to work within a remote, collaborative development team.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?

I’m most excited to develop my skills in:
- Writing and maintaining automated tests (e.g., Playwright, Cypress)
- Understanding and contributing to CI workflows using GitHub Actions
- Applying clean code principles and code review feedback
- Communicating effectively in a professional development team

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?

I bring strong attention to detail, a willingness to learn, and a proactive mindset. I’m comfortable documenting bugs and testing edge cases, and I’m eager to take initiative on QA tasks. I’m also confident in my ability to give and receive constructive feedback and contribute to a positive, growth-focused team environment.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

I’d like to improve my confidence in writing automated tests from scratch — especially end-to-end tests. I’m still learning how to choose the right assertions and structure test flows, and I hope to get more hands-on experience with this during the internship.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?

Success would mean:
- Actively contributing to the QA process through test writing and reporting
- Completing key internship milestones with quality work
- Gaining confidence in automated testing and CI tools
- Receiving positive feedback from my mentor and teammates
- Feeling more prepared for a QA or software development role after graduation
