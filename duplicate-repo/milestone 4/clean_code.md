# Clean Code Reflection

## How do unit tests help keep code clean?

Unit tests help make sure each function works the way it’s supposed to. It makes the code cleaner because I have to think about how to break it down into smaller parts that are easier to test. If I change something later, the tests will tell me if I broke anything. That way I can fix it quickly.

Also, writing tests forces me to write better code — not messy or complicated. It’s easier to read, reuse, and understand. So it keeps the code clean and not confusing.

## What issues did you find while testing?

While testing my function, I saw that I didn’t think about all edge cases — like what happens if I multiply by 0 or use a negative number. The tests helped me notice that.

Also, I had to move my logic into a separate function to make it easier to test. That actually made my code better and more organized. So writing tests helped me find small mistakes and improve the way I wrote the function.
