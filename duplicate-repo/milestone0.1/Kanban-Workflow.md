## How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?  
Kanban helps manage priorities by providing a **visual representation** of tasks, allowing teams to see what needs to be done, what is in progress, and what is completed. It ensures that high-priority tasks are addressed first while preventing teams from taking on too many tasks at once.  

By setting **Work in Progress (WIP) limits**, Kanban prevents overload, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently before new ones are started. This structured approach reduces stress, improves productivity, and enhances workflow management.  

## How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?  
I can improve my workflow using Kanban principles by:  
- **Tracking tasks effectively**: Keeping tasks updated on the Kanban board ensures clarity on progress and responsibilities.  
- **Setting WIP limits**: Avoiding multitasking by focusing on a limited number of tasks at a time.  
- **Regular backlog refinement**: Reviewing and prioritizing tasks regularly to ensure the most important work gets done first.  
- **Identifying and resolving bottlenecks**: Using the board to spot tasks that are stuck in "Blocked" or "In Progress" for too long and addressing them quickly.  

By following these practices, I can work more efficiently, stay organized, and ensure a smoother workflow. ðŸš€
