## How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?  
Agile ceremonies provide structured opportunities for team members to communicate, share updates, and align their efforts.  
- **Daily stand-ups** keep everyone informed about ongoing work and blockers, ensuring quick issue resolution.  
- **Sprint planning** ensures that the team is aligned on goals and priorities before starting new work.  
- **Retrospectives** allow teams to reflect on their processes and make improvements.  
- **Backlog refinement** ensures clarity on upcoming tasks and helps prioritize work efficiently.  

These ceremonies foster transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement, ensuring that the team remains aligned and productive.  

## Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?  
The **daily stand-up** is the most important ceremony for my role because it provides a regular opportunity to share progress, discuss blockers, and align with the team. By identifying and addressing issues early, it helps prevent delays and ensures smooth workflow. The quick and focused nature of stand-ups keeps everyone on the same page without taking too much time away from actual work.
