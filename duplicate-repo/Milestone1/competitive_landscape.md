# Competitive Landscape: Focus Bear vs Other Productivity Apps

## 1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Focus Bear is unique because it combines behaviorally-informed design with structured habit stacking and distraction blocking. Unlike Freedom and Cold Turkey, which primarily focus on blocking distractions, Focus Bear integrates goal tracking, mindfulness, physical exercise prompts, and productivity sessions in a single platform. Compared to Tiimo and Routinery, which focus on daily routines and visual scheduling, Focus Bear offers a more holistic approach that encourages both digital wellbeing and physical wellbeing.

**Unique Features of Focus Bear:**
- Guided habit routines with custom visual prompts
- Integration of physical activity and meditation into work sessions
- Pomodoro-like structured flow that blocks apps/sites automatically
- Strong ADHD-friendly design

## 2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

As a user, I would choose Focus Bear if I wanted an all-in-one system for managing my routine, minimizing distractions, and promoting wellbeing without switching between multiple tools. Its structured routine builder and timed productivity sessions with integrated breaks help with habit formation, which is ideal for users struggling with executive dysfunction.

Focus Bear feels like a coach rather than just a tool — it nudges you toward healthier behavior while helping you stay focused.

## 3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

 **visual timelines** that make it very easy to see and plan the day at a glance. The visual interfaces are engaging and accessible for neurodiverse users. Focus Bear currently lacks a customizable **visual calendar/timeline view** that allows users to rearrange or edit their routines more intuitively.

## 4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

Focus Bear could benefit from integrating **more flexible planning tools**, such as:
- A drag-and-drop daily/weekly visual planner
- Integration with external calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Visual feedback on habit completion trends over time

These improvements would help users better plan and reflect on their routines — combining the strength of Tiimo’s visuals with Focus Bear’s habit stacking.
