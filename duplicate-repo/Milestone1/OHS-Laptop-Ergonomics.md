# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) Reflections

## Equipment Changes to Improve Workspace Setup
- **Currently Using**:
  - Laptop stand: Helps elevate the screen to a more ergonomic height.
  - Adjustable chair: Provides better support and adjustability for maintaining good posture.
- **Needs**:
  - **Larger Desk**: A larger desk is required to comfortably rest my arms and have sufficient space for all my working tools, reducing strain.

## Behavioral Changes to Improve Posture and Reduce Strain
- **Screen Height Adjustment**: I need to adjust my screen height to ensure it is at or just below eye level, which will help in reducing neck strain.
- **Regular Breaks**: Committing to taking regular breaks from the screen, aiming for a brief pause every hour to rest my eyes and stretch, which will help in maintaining energy and focus throughout the day.

## Reminders for Maintaining Good Posture and Breaks
- **Using Focus Bear**: I plan to install Focus Bear on my laptop for work purposes. The app will be set up to remind me to take movement breaks and maintain good posture throughout the day. Being a user of Focus Bear now integrates these reminders seamlessly into my work routine.
