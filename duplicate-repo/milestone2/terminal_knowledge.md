# Terminal Knowledge  

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?  
I chose **Visual Studio’s integrated terminal** because it allows me to execute commands directly while working on my code. It supports multiple shells like **PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash, and WSL**, making it flexible. Additionally, since I’m using **GitHub Desktop**, this setup helps me manage my repositories efficiently without switching between applications.  

## What customizations (if any) did you make?  
- Changed the default shell in **Visual Studio Terminal** to **Git Bash** for better Git compatibility.  
- Adjusted the terminal font size and color scheme for better readability.  
- Added aliases to simplify frequently used commands, e.g., `gs` for `git status`.  

## What was the most useful command you learned today?  
The most useful command I learned today is:  

git status
git add .
git push origin main
