## Reflection

### Which shortcuts do you think will be most useful in your daily work?

The most useful shortcuts for me will be:
- **Alt + Click** for multiple cursors: great for editing repeated lines or values.
- **Ctrl + P** to quickly jump between files.
- **Ctrl + `** to open/close the terminal without leaving VS Code.

These help me work faster without moving my hands off the keyboard or losing focus.
