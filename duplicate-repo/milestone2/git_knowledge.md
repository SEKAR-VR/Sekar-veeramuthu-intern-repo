# Git Knowledge  

## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?  
I am **new to Git** and currently learning how to use it for version control. I am using Git to manage code changes, track progress, and collaborate on projects. My main focus is integrating Git with **Visual Studio** and **GitHub Desktop** to simplify my workflow.  

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?  
I chose **GitHub Desktop** and **Git in VS Code** because:  
- **GitHub Desktop** provides a user-friendly interface for managing commits, branches, and pull requests without needing to use command-line commands.  
- **VS Codeâ€™s built-in Git integration** allows me to work directly within my editor, making it easy to track changes, commit updates, and push/pull code.  
- Both tools help me **visualize changes** and gradually get comfortable with Git commands while also offering an efficient way to manage repositories.  

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?  
The most interesting thing I learned is **how Git tracks changes and allows reverting to previous versions**. The `git log` command shows a history of commits, and `git checkout <commit-hash>` lets me access past versions of my project. This means I can experiment with changes without the risk of permanently losing previous work, which makes version control extremely powerful. ðŸš€
